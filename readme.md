## by Ali Rostami


## Dataset

Here, we are going to analyze a data set from the PISA program which is an international assessment program of education and schooloing systems through different countries. Particularly, this data, which we analyze here, contian the assessments of performance of students in Math, Science, and Reading. We have already cleaned the data and removed several unnecessary and null data using other python files (available in this git).


## Summary of Findings

We could infer how students are performing in math based on their birth countries as well as their parents' birth countries. We have measured this
performance based on three scores of math, reading, and science.
 


## Key Insights for Presentation

We have measured this performance based on three scores of math, reading, and science. Also, we finally shortly look at the teach behavior distribution through the countries.
